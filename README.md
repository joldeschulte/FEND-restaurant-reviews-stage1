#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the first stage of the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I've started to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### Specification

I have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. Thank you Udacity/Google team!

### To Run The App

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` (or some other port, if port 8080 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8080`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install Python 3.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8080`.
3. Enjoy the mobile friendly, accessible restaurant reviews!
